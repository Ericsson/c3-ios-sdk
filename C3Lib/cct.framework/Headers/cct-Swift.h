/**
  Represents a live query that selects a subset of all rooms and transforms them using a map function.
  Whenever a room receives an event, the map function is run for every query. If the map function returns a falsy
  value, it is ignored. If the value is truthy, the value is added to the resulting rows.
  version:
  1.0.0
  <h4>Example</h4>
  This is an example of a map function that lists all public rooms that the user is a member of:
  \code
  { room -> AnyObject? in
      if room.membership == .member && room.visibility == .public {
          return room
      }
      return nil
  }

  \endcodeWhenever the value returned by the map function changes, an \code
  update
  \endcode event is emitted, as well as \code
  added
  \endcode and/or
  \code
  removed
  \endcode events. The value is considered changed if it switches between truthy and falsy, or if the id property of
  the value changes.
  This is an example of a map function that lists all rooms to which the user has been invited, as well as the
  inviting user:
  \code
  { room -> AnyObject? in
      if room.membership == .invited {
          return [
              "user": room.invitedBy!,
              "room": room
          ]
      }
      return nil
  }

  \endcode<h4>Events</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      \code
      added
      \endcode:   Emitted when a row is added to the result of the query. Receives added row.
    </li>
    <li>
      \code
      removed
      \endcode: Emitted when a row is removed from the result of the query. Receives removed row.
    </li>
    <li>
      \code
      updated
      \endcode: Emitted when the result of the query has changed. Receives updated row.

  It is best to avoid relying on the returned promise to modify application state, e.g. UI updates, as that will

  state was changed was successfully, and tie application state changes an \code
  update
  \endcode event handler. This is due to
  the fact that state changes are received via the event stream, but the returned promise is resolved when the
  request is returned, and those two events can happen in any order.
